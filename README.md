# Liver-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Enhancing-Early-Detection-and-Survival-Analysis-25252
## üìå Project Overview  
Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of liver cancer can significantly improve survival rates and help healthcare professionals make timely decisions. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict liver cancer risk and survival outcomes using various patient-related and environmental features.  

The dataset contains **160,292 records** with features like demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors, and healthcare access. Three machine learning models ‚Äî **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Logistic Regression** ‚Äî were applied to develop a robust classification pipeline, and their performance was compared using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üìà Model Performance Comparison  

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |  
|------------------------|----------|------------|--------|----------|  
| **Random Forest**      | 0.7687   | High       | High   | High     |  
| **XGBoost**            | 0.7946   | High       | High   | High     |  
| **Logistic Regression**| 0.7098   | Moderate   | Moderate| Moderate|  

### Key Insights  
- **XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (79.45%)** and overall better performance across metrics.  
- **Random Forest performed well (76.87%)** and provided a good balance between accuracy and interpretability.  
- **Logistic Regression (70.98%)** showed lower accuracy, indicating that the relationship between features and the target variable is likely nonlinear.
